                <p>
                    Welcome to Are you dead?! We care about your privacy as much as you care about staying alive. This policy explains how we handle your data while you're still walking among us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using Are you dead?, you agree that we can store just enough info to make sure someone knows if you've stopped breathing.

                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>We Do NOT Actively Collect Any Data:</strong>
                    <p>Here's the deal: We don't actively collect, store, or track your personal data. Period. Your privacy is sacred to us, and we respect it completely.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> actively collect your name, email, or any personal identifiers.</li>

                        <li>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> actively access your contacts or any other device data.</li>
                        <li>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> actively use analytics or tracking tools.</li>
                        <li>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> sell, share, or monetize any data (because we don't actively collect any).</li>

                <h2>3. What We Actually Need (Minimal & Optional)</h2>
                <p>The only information we might need is what you voluntarily provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Contact (Optional):</strong> If you choose to set up an emergency contact, you provide their name and email. This is stored locally on your device and only used to send alerts if you miss check-ins. We don't store this on our servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check-in Status (Local Only):</strong> Your check-in records are stored locally on your device. We don't have access to them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Everything else stays on your device. We can't see it. We don't want to see it.</strong></p>

                <h2>4. How We Keep You Safe Without Your Data</h2>
                <p>You might wonder: "How does this work if you don't actively collect data?"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local-First Design:</strong> All your data lives on your device. We built the app to work without needing your personal information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optional Cloud Sync:</strong> If you choose to enable cloud sync (completely optional), your data is encrypted and stored securely. You can disable it anytime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency Alerts:</strong> If you set up an emergency contact, alerts are sent directly from your device or through an encrypted service. We don't store or access this information.</li>

                <h2>5. Data Storage (Spoiler: There Isn't Much)</h2>
                
                <h3>5.1 Local Storage</h3>
                <p>All your data stays on your device. We don't have servers full of your information because we don't actively collect it in the first place.</p>

                <h3>5.2 Optional Cloud Storage</h3>
                <p>If you enable cloud sync (your choice), your data is encrypted end-to-end. We can't read it even if we wanted to. And you can delete it anytime by disabling sync or deleting the app.</p>

                <h3>5.3 Data Retention</h3>
                <p>Since we don't actively collect your data, there's nothing to retain. When you delete the app, everything disappears. Poof. Gone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h2>6. Your Rights (You Have All of Them)</h2>
                <p>Since we don't actively collect your data, you have complete control:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full Control:</strong> All your data is on your device. Delete the app, and it's gone.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We can't track you because we don't actively collect anything to track with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Your privacy isn't a feature—it's the foundation of how we built this app.</li>
